### In a Nutshell
My config is a hybrid and slightly reduced version of Zabooby's and Ujjwal-dev23's 

### Black Magic
Despite having absolute windows paths in Zabooby's part the config works flawlessly on linux. Nothing I use seems broken. I have no idea why.

### Small Thing
Kindly change gpu-api to vulkun (or is it vulkan?)
I use d3d11 because I have nvidia gpu only and vulkan/vulkun was giving me problems on non-standard resolutions such as 960p.

### In case you didn't read the docs
- For Linux: Clone this repo rename portable_config to mpv and move the folder mpv to .config/ 
- For Wind00z: read the docs idk

### Last but not the Least
Pressing S for screenshot will throw you error because YOU are supposed to set screenshot directory in the mpv.conf
I didn't set any path because I just use prtscr. Change shader paths appropriately
